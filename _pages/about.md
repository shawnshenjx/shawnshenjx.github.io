About Me
======
Junxiao Shen is an incoming lecturer (equivalent to assistant professor in the US) in immersive technologies at the School of Computer Science, University of Bristol. He will be a joint member of both [Bristol Vision Institute (BVI)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/vision-institute/) and [Bristol Inteaction Group (BIG)](http://biglab.co.uk/). He was supervised by Professor Per Ola Kristensson for his Ph.D. at the Intelligent Interactive Systems Group, University of Cambridge.

He has received a number of full scholarships, including the Dulwich Scholarship for his A-Level studies in London, UK; the Jardine Scholarship (comparable to the Oxford Rhodes Scholar); and the Trinity Mainland China Bursary (having ranked 1st in the college admission test) for his undergraduate and postgraduate studies at Trinity College, University of Cambridge.


His research interests include innovating next-generation input techniques (e.g., text entry, gestural interactions) and interactive AI applications (e.g., context-aware, multi-modal AI for super virtual assistants) within Mixed Reality (MR), which he believes is the next-generation computing platform. He thinks that combining AI and MR can augment human abilities. He proposes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to solve interactive problems for the next-generation computing platform.
